# SoftwareSPI

## THIS IS STILL BEING WORKED ON AND IS NOT FIT FOR USE YET

This is an Arduino library to impliment a  bit-banged Software SPI communication  
layer.  

The built-in hardware SPI is perfectly fine, but has some limitations -  
SoftwareSPI aims to fix some of those problems, and add some additional features  
that increase user understanding, compatability, speed etc.

## Usage
Still need to finish main API before I can flesh this out


## Todo
* See if syncronous read and write is popular enough to impliment
* Research what defines SPI vs a generic serial interface
